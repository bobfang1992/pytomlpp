This is an unofficial python wrapper for tomlplusplus (https://marzer.github.io/tomlplusplus/).

Some points you may want to know before use:
* Using `tomlplusplus` means that this module is fully compatible with TOML v1.0.0. 
* We convert toml structure to native python data structures (dict/list etc.) when parsing, this is more inline with what `json` module does.
* The binding is using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).
* The project is tested using [toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test) and [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).

# Why bother?
There are some exisitng python TOML parser on the market but from my experience they are all purely implemented in python which is a bit slow.

# Installing

We recommand you to use `conda` to install this package:

```sh
conda install -c dorafmon pytomlpp
```

If you are not using `conda` then please install from source:

```
git clone git@github.com:bobfang1992/pytomlpp.git
cd pytomlpp
pip install .
```

## Why not pypi?
Pypi has some rules on how to distribute pre-compiled binary for different platforms. I do not have enough experties in this area. I would love to see contribution to make this package avaliable on pypi.
