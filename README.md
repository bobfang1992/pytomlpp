You can try this parser online [here](http://toml-parser.com).

This is an unofficial python wrapper for `toml++` (https://marzer.github.io/tomlplusplus/).

Some points you may want to know before use:
* Using `toml++` means that this module is fully compatible with TOML [v1.0.0-rc.3](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0-rc.3). 
* We convert toml structure to native python data structures (dict/list etc.) when parsing, this is more inline with what `json` module does.
* The binding is using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11).
* The project is tested using [toml-test](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml-test) and [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).

# Why bother?
There are some exisitng python TOML parser on the market but from my experience they are all purely implemented in python which is a bit slow.

# Installing

We recommand you to use `pip` to install this package:
```sh
pip install pytomlpp
```

You can also use `conda` to install this package, Note we only support linux 64 python 3.8 for now, I would love to provide this package on more python versions and platforms via conda but I have not found a way yet to automate this in the CI, if you know how to do this please contribute!

```sh
conda install -c dorafmon pytomlpp
```

You can also install from source:

```
git clone git@github.com:bobfang1992/pytomlpp.git --recurse-submodules=third_party/tomlplusplus --shallow-submodules
cd pytomlpp
pip install .
```
